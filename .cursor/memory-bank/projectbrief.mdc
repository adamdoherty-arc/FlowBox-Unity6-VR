# FlowBox - VR Rhythm Boxing Game - Project Brief

## Project Vision
A VR rhythm game that combines boxing mechanics with music synchronization, where players punch colored circles and block spinning obstacles in time with the beat.

## Core Concept
- **NOT traditional boxing** - this is a rhythm/music game
- Players stand in VR and punch approaching circles with correct hands
- **White circles = LEFT HAND**, **Gray circles = RIGHT HAND** (critical rule)
- Circles combine at center to create spinning blocks that must be blocked
- **Speed correlation**: Faster approach = faster spin = higher difficulty
- All gameplay synchronized to music beats and BPM

## Target Platforms
- **Primary**: Meta Quest 2/3 (standalone VR)
- **Secondary**: PC VR (Steam VR, Oculus Rift)
- **Performance**: 90 FPS (Quest 3), 72 FPS minimum (Quest 2)

## Key Requirements

### Gameplay Mechanics
1. **Circle Spawning**: White from left, gray from right, approach center
2. **Hand Detection**: Accurate left/right hand tracking and punch detection
3. **Block Creation**: Circles combine â†’ spinning block appears
4. **Blocking Mechanic**: Players must block spinning obstacles with both hands
5. **Music Sync**: All spawning and timing based on beat detection

### Technical Requirements
1. **Unity 6**: Latest features including Job System and Burst compilation
2. **VR Comfort**: No motion sickness, proper ergonomics
3. **Performance**: Consistent frame rates with auto-optimization
4. **Audio Analysis**: Real-time beat detection and BPM analysis
5. **Fallback Systems**: Controller support, local music if Spotify fails

### User Experience
1. **Intuitive**: Easy to understand (white=left, gray=right)
2. **Progressive**: Difficulty scales with player skill and music BPM
3. **Immersive**: HD backgrounds that react to music
4. **Accessible**: Multiple difficulty levels, comfort options

## Success Metrics
- Smooth 90 FPS performance on Quest 3
- Accurate hand tracking with <50ms latency
- Music synchronization within 10ms of beat
- Intuitive gameplay (new players understand in <30 seconds)
- Engaging progression (players want to improve scores)

## Current Status: 85% Complete
- All core systems implemented and functional
- Scripts compile without errors
- Advanced Unity 6 features integrated
- Missing: VR scene setup, prefab creation, UI instantiation

## Next Milestone
Get to 100% playable state by completing:
1. XR Origin VR setup
2. Prefab generation and assignment
3. UI canvas creation
4. Audio track integration
5. Hand collider configuration

This is a **rhythm game first, boxing second** - the boxing is just the interaction method for hitting musical beats.
